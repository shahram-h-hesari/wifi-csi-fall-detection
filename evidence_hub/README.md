## Overview

The **Secure WiFi Healthcare AI Evidence Hub** is a curated research initiative focused on organizing scientific evidence around **WiFi CSI-based healthcare AI sensing**.

The project maps papers, datasets, code releases, reproducibility notes, security relevance, and open research gaps for contactless sensing systems that may support future care-aware environments such as assisted living, aging-in-place research, and non-invasive activity or vital-sign monitoring studies.

The goal is to make the research landscape easier to understand, compare, reproduce, and extend.

## Research Motivation

WiFi sensing has shown promise for contactless monitoring tasks such as activity recognition, fall detection, respiration estimation, and other healthcare-relevant sensing problems. However, many systems are evaluated mainly under normal operating conditions.

For future AI-enabled sensing in care-aware environments, the field needs stronger evidence around:

- Dataset availability and limitations
- Code availability and reproducibility
- Robustness under noise, domain shift, and adversarial conditions
- Security risks at the wireless physical layer
- Clear mapping between sensing failures and real-world care scenarios
- Open research gaps that require collaboration across AI/ML, wireless sensing, cybersecurity, and healthcare technology

This hub is designed to organize that evidence in a structured, transparent, and collaboration-friendly way.
